                            Vera Frenkel's 1974 photograph during the teleconferencing performance, String Games, not only captures a pivotal moment in her early exploration of technology but also reveals a more contemplative side, hinting at the potential of an unrealized digital universe. This image foretells the directions her artistic practice would take, emphasizing the integral role of screens in her quest to examine how memory is influenced by image transmission in our electronic age. Frenkel's subsequent works critically engage with Marshall McLuhan's notion of a globally embraced nervous system, weaving multiple narratives through staged encounters with technology's utopian promises.</td>

                            Paul Soulellis talks about how sharing information has changed over time, from putting up notices in the past to now having continuous feeds on social media. He says we need to be careful with the way we get information from the internet, and he suggests some ways to stop and think about what we see online. It is important to be smart and thoughtful when using the internet and not just believe everything we see.

                            The reading explores the intersection of technology, community, and individual identity through the lens of Gem's journey. I felt that introducing the Beyond as a space of possibility within Gem's imagination and intuition provides a contrast to the rigid structures of technology.

                            The text explores the intertwining realms of war, automation, and algorithms. It challenges conventional views on war, suggesting it might be more humane if similar to a reversible video game. The discussion on automation's impact, from game-like labor to the blurred lines between humans and robots, prompts reflection. The text focuses on ethical concerns about social credit scores and algorithmic rankings, urging readers to scrutinize the fairness and transparency of such systems.
