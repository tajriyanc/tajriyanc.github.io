                            'The point Carrion is conveying is that Mail Art isn't just about sending postcards - it's about using the postal system as a tool to be creative! Adding on to our class discussion, the "Big Monster" represents the postal system and adds an element of resistance and rebellion to Mail Art, emphasizing its role as a means to connect and communicate in a world often characterized by isolation. The idea of measuring Mail Art's impact through responses and harmony rather than traditional methods of art offers a refreshing perspective on how art can be enjoyed within this unconventional medium.'</td>

I also want to highlight Laurel's mention of 'nothing exists in isolation.' In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information from various sources, it's essential to understand the interconnectedness of ideas, concepts, and knowledge. Building personal reading networks allows us to transcend the confines of traditional, linear thinking and embrace a more holistic approach to understanding the world.'                    </td>

                            'The reading provided a great exploration of the evolving publishing landscape, emphasizing the unique challenges faced by print in the digital age from the coexistence of analog and digital mediums. Something I took away was how the power of digital publishing lies in its networking capabilities, prompting designers to focus on creating interconnected digital experiences. The digital era is no longer a revolutionary phenomenon but has become an integral part of our everyday lives.'

The web has now been in existence for nearly two decades, evolving from a new medium into what we now refer to as new media. Its inherent "stupidity" and neutrality, which form the foundation of its architecture, allow it to continually adapt and grow without becoming old or mature. This perpetual youthfulness means that the web is in a constant state of renewal.'</td>

                        'From a part of the reading, Price underscores how avant-garde art, while pushing boundaries, often requires the context provided by institutions, curators, and historians to be fully appreciated, showing the complex interplay between artistic innovation and the established art system, where even radical works undergo a form of peer-review within the community. Reflecting on this, the observation shows the importance of documentation and discussion in defining an artwork's status and value in the art world, drawing parallels between the art field and professional disciplines like science.'                    </td>
